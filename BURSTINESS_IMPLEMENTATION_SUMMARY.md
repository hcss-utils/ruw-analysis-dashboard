# Burstiness Tab Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Burstiness tab is a new feature added to the RUW analysis dashboard, offering advanced analysis of temporal patterns and significant spikes in the frequency of taxonomic elements, keywords, and named entities. This feature leverages Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm along with additional statistical techniques to identify emerging trends, sudden events, and significant shifts in discourse within the Russian-Ukrainian War dataset.

## Key Components and Architecture

### 1. Core Burst Detection Algorithms

The burst detection functionality is implemented in `utils/burst_detection.py` and includes:

- **Basic Kleinberg Burst Detection (2-state)**: Identifies bursts using a simple two-state model that distinguishes between normal and burst states.
- **Multi-state Kleinberg Burst Detection (n-state)**: A more sophisticated implementation that supports multiple levels of burst intensity.
- **Statistical Validation of Bursts**: Uses confidence intervals and Z-scores to validate burst significance.
- **Co-occurrence Detection**: Identifies elements that burst together, revealing related trends.
- **Cascade Pattern Analysis**: Detects potential causal relationships where bursts in one element lead to bursts in others.

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing flow is implemented in `database/data_fetchers_freshness.py` and includes:

- Functions to fetch taxonomy elements, keywords, and named entities from the database.
- Period-based data aggregation (weeks, months, quarters) to enable temporal analysis.
- Processing functions that apply burst detection algorithms to the fetched data.
- Summary statistics calculations to support visualization and analysis.

### 3. Advanced Visualizations

The visualizations are implemented in `visualizations/bursts.py` and include:

- **Burst Heatmaps**: Show intensity of bursts across elements and time periods.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**: When the user selects parameters and clicks "Run Burstiness Analysis":
   - The system calculates appropriate time period boundaries
   - Database queries retrieve document counts for each element by date
   - Data is filtered according to user-selected criteria

2. **Burst Detection**:
   - Raw count data is processed through the selected algorithm
   - Burst intensities are calculated and normalized
   - Additional metrics (e.g., statistical significance) are calculated

3. **Visualization Creation**:
   - Burst data is transformed into the format needed for each visualization
   - Plotly figures are generated with appropriate styling and interactivity
   - Historical events and document links are integrated if selected

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Click events on visualizations trigger concordance table updates
   - Document preview modals show content on demand
   - Export functions allow saving data in CSV and JSON formats

### Algorithmic Details

#### Basic Kleinberg Algorithm

The algorithm identifies bursts by:
1. Calculating a baseline rate for each element
2. Identifying periods where frequency exceeds the baseline by a factor of `s`
3. Applying a cost model for transitioning between normal and burst states
4. Calculating burst intensity based on the ratio of observed to expected frequency

#### Multi-state Implementation

The multi-state version extends this by:
1. Supporting multiple burst states with increasing intensity levels
2. Using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to find the optimal state sequence
3. Applying the Viterbi algorithm to determine the most likely state sequence
4. Handling transitions between different burst states with varying costs

#### Statistical Validation

Statistical validation adds:
1. Local and global confidence intervals for burst detection
2. Z-score calculations to quantify deviation from expected values
3. P-value calculations to determine statistical significance
4. Window-based analysis to account for local baseline shifts
