# All Issues Fixed Summary

## 1. ✅ Citation Formatting (Explore Tab)
- Removed duplicate "Language" display
- Changed font size from 13px to 16px to match content
- Reordered elements as requested: Author, Source, Section, Date, etc.
- Integrated chunk position info into Section field

## 2. ✅ Sources Tab Not Displaying
- Added missing `sources-result-stats` div
- Fixed callback to trigger on initial load
- Set `prevent_initial_call=False`

## 3. ✅ Responsive Design
- Removed 1800px max-width constraint (now 100%)
- Made all Plotly charts responsive with `autosize=True`
- Added proper breakpoints for all device sizes:
  - Mobile (< 576px)
  - Tablets (577-768px)
  - Small desktops (769-992px)
  - Regular desktops (993-1200px)
  - Large desktops (> 1201px)
- Filter cards stack on mobile
- Tables scroll horizontally on small screens

## 4. ✅ Programmatic Loading Animation
- Created comprehensive loading state monitor
- Tracks ALL loading states:
  - Component loading (`data-dash-is-loading`)
  - Plotly graph rendering
  - Callback executions
  - Nested components
- Radar pulse stays visible until ALL elements are loaded
- No hardcoded timeouts - purely event-driven
- Debug features in browser console:
  ```javascript
  dashLoadingMonitor.getStates()  // Check loading states
  dashLoadingMonitor.forceHide()   // Manual control
  dashLoadingMonitor.forceShow()
  ```
