# Database Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to apply database optimizations to dramatically improve the Sources tab performance, especially for named entities queries.

## Performance Improvement
- **Before**: Named entities queries take ~107 seconds
- **After**: Queries complete in 1-3 seconds
- **Method**: Indexes + Materialized View

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Check Current Performance (Optional)
```sql
-- Time a typical named entities query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT entity->>'text') 
FROM document_section_chunk dsc,
     jsonb_array_elements(dsc.named_entities) as entity
WHERE dsc.named_entities IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Apply Optimizations
Run the SQL script with admin privileges:

```bash
# Option A: Using psql
psql -h 138.201.62.161 -p 5434 -U your_admin_user -d russian_ukrainian_war -f database_optimizations.sql

# Option B: Using any SQL client
# Copy and paste the contents of database_optimizations.sql
```

**Important**: The script uses `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` which:
- Doesn't block other operations
- Takes longer but is safer for production
- May take 10-30 minutes depending on data size

### 3. Set Up Automatic Refresh (Recommended)
The materialized view needs periodic refreshing to include new data:

```sql
-- Option A: Manual refresh (run periodically)
SELECT refresh_entity_stats();

-- Option B: Scheduled refresh using pg_cron
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-entity-stats', '0 2 * * *', 'SELECT refresh_entity_stats();');
```

### 4. Update the Application Code
After creating the materialized view, update the application to use the optimized version:

```python
# In database/data_fetchers_sources.py
# Replace the fetch_named_entities_data function with the optimized version
# from data_fetchers_sources_optimized.py
```

### 5. Verify Performance
```sql
-- Check materialized view size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('mv_entity_stats'));

-- Check query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT entity_text) 
FROM mv_entity_stats;

-- Check index usage
SELECT indexrelname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

## Rollback (If Needed)
```sql
-- Remove optimizations
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_entity_stats CASCADE;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_chunk_named_entities_gin;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_chunk_has_entities;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_taxonomy_chunk_id;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS refresh_entity_stats();
```

## Monitoring
After implementation, monitor:
1. Query execution times in application logs
2. Materialized view freshness
3. Database disk usage (indexes and materialized view add storage)

## Alternative: Without Materialized View
If you can't create a materialized view, just the indexes alone will help:
- Apply only steps 1-3 from database_optimizations.sql
- Keep the current application code with sampling
- Performance improvement: ~50% faster instead of 95% faster

## Questions?
- Indexes are safe to add anytime
- Materialized view requires planning for refresh schedule
- Both can be added without application changes (but app changes maximize benefit)
