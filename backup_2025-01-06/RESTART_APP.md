# Please Restart the App

The changes made to fix the Sources tab require restarting the app to take effect.

## Changes Made:

1. **Added safe formatting** - All `:,` format strings now check if the value is numeric before formatting
2. **Added error handling** - Each visualization function has its own try-except block
3. **Fixed field names** - All field names now match what the data fetchers return
4. **Added detailed logging** - To help identify where errors occur

## To Apply Changes:
1. Stop the current app (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again with `python app.py`

The Sources tab should now:
- Show visualizations without format errors
- Display the loading text box during data fetch
- Hide the text box when complete
