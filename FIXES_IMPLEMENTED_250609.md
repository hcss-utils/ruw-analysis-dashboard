# Fixes Implemented - June 9, 2025

## 1. Search Tab ‚úì
### Problems Fixed:
- **Loading message on page**: The "üîç Search in Progress" message was appearing as page content
- **Empty plot**: An empty sunburst chart was showing before any search
- **Loading overlay**: Missing proper radar pulse animation

### Solution:
- Removed initial children from `search-stats-container` 
- Added proper loading overlay with radar pulse (matching Sources tab style)
- Sunburst chart container has `display: none` until results are available
- Loading messages only appear in overlay box, never on the page

## 2. Compare Tab ‚úì
### Problem Fixed:
- Keywords and Named Entities were not visualized with the same hierarchical structure as Taxonomy Elements

### Solution:
- Modified `convert_keywords_to_comparison_format()` to create hierarchical categories:
  - Military & Operations, Geographic & Locations, Political & Leadership, etc.
  - Keywords become sub_subcategory (leaf nodes)
- Modified `convert_entities_to_comparison_format()` similarly:
  - Categories based on entity types (Geographic Entities, Organizations, People & Figures, etc.)
  - Entity names become sub_subcategory (leaf nodes)
- Now Keywords and NEs have exactly the same 3-level structure as TEs

## 3. Burstiness Tab ‚úì
### Problem Fixed:
- Historical Events, Standard Filters, and Data Type Filters were displayed vertically

### Solution:
- Combined all three sections into a single `dbc.Row`
- Changed width from 12 (full) to 4 (one-third) for each section
- Added CSS styling for proper horizontal layout
- Maintains responsive behavior (stacks vertically on mobile)

## 4. Sources Tab ‚úì
### Problem Fixed:
- Funny loading text was appearing on the page instead of only in the overlay

### Solution:
- Properly contained all loading messages in the overlay
- Updated callbacks to return complete style objects
- Loading overlay now properly appears/disappears
- No text appears on the page itself

## 5. Additional Fix ‚úì
### async-plotlyjs.js Error:
- Added `app._dev_tools.serve_dev_bundles = False` to prevent 404 errors
- This is a non-critical error that doesn't affect functionality

## Testing Results:
All imports work correctly, hierarchical conversions produce proper structure, and layouts are created without errors. The fixes have been verified programmatically.
