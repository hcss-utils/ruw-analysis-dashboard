# Format and Spinner Improvements

These changes enhance the user experience with the search functionality by improving number formatting and adding better spinner feedback:

## Improvements

1. **Thousands Separators for Readability**
   - Added thousands separators to ALL numeric values in the dashboard
   - Updated search results counter, pagination information, and category counts
   - Makes large numbers much more readable (e.g., \1,234\ instead of \1234\)

2. **Better Loading Feedback**
   - Added a dedicated loading spinner specifically for sunburst segment clicks
   - Positioned the spinner directly beneath the sunburst chart
   - Made the spinner color match the blue color of the text boxes (#13376f)
   - Provides clear visual feedback when filtering results by category

3. **Consistent Formatting**
   - Ensured all numeric displays use the same formatting approach
   - Updated page indicators to show formatted numbers everywhere

## Implementation Details

- Used the format_number utility function consistently throughout the code
- Added a new loading indicator div triggered by the sunburst click callback
- Modified callbacks to include the loading indicator in their outputs
- Positioned the loading indicator strategically for maximum visibility

These changes significantly improve the usability of the dashboard, especially when working with large result sets and when filtering results via the sunburst chart.
