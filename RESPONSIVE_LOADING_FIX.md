# Responsive Design and Loading Animation Fix

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Radar Pulse Stopping Too Early
- The loading animation was stopping when ANY loading element was removed, not when ALL were done
- Fixed by tracking all active loading states in a Set
- Only hide radar sweep when no loading elements remain

### 2. Non-Responsive Layout
- Charts had fixed width (700px) preventing responsive behavior
- Dashboard container had max-width of 1800px
- No proper responsive breakpoints for different devices

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Loading Script (loading-fix.js)
- Tracks all active loading states in a Set
- Only hides radar sweep when ALL loading is complete
- Better detection of loading elements being added/removed
- 30-second fallback timeout to prevent infinite loading

### 2. Responsive CSS (responsive-fix.css)
- Removed max-width constraints on dashboard container
- Made all Plotly charts responsive with 100% width
- Added proper breakpoints for:
  - Mobile (< 576px)
  - Tablets (577-768px)
  - Small desktops (769-992px)
  - Regular desktops (993-1200px)
  - Large desktops (> 1201px)
- Fixed column stacking on mobile
- Made filter cards stack vertically on small screens
- Added horizontal scroll for tables on mobile

### 3. Chart Configuration Updates
- Updated sunburst charts to use `autosize=True`
- Removed fixed width from visualizations
- Charts now scale with container width

1. `static/loading-fix.js` - New enhanced loading script
2. `static/responsive-fix.css` - New responsive styles
3. `visualizations/sunburst.py` - Made charts responsive
4. `app.py` - Included new CSS and JS files
