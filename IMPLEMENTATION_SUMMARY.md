# Keyword Consolidation Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive keyword consolidation system that maps variant forms of keywords and entities to canonical forms, while also filtering out noise terms. This enhances analysis by providing more consistent and meaningful results.

## Implementation Details

1. **Created Core Mapping Functionality**
   - Implemented `utils/keyword_mapping.py` module with functions for mapping and aggregation
   - Added configurable excluded keywords list for filtering noise terms
   - Implemented mapping loading from CSV files with graceful fallbacks

2. **Added Sample Mapping Files Generation**
   - Created `create_sample_mapping_files.py` script to generate initial mapping files
   - Set up a `data/` directory for storing mapping files
   - Generated two mapping files:
     - `consolidated_keywords.csv`: Canonical keywords and frequencies
     - `cross_type_entities.csv`: Variants mapping to canonical forms

3. **Integrated with Data Fetching**
   - Modified `database/data_fetchers.py` to use keyword mapping in search functions
   - Updated `database/data_fetchers_freshness.py` to apply mapping in burst detection
   - Added logging to track when mapping is applied

4. **Enhanced UI to Reflect Mapping**
   - Added information about keyword mapping in the Burstiness tab
   - Updated labels to indicate that consolidated keywords are displayed
   - Enhanced the About modal with details about keyword mapping

5. **Added Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive `KEYWORD_MAPPING.md` document
   - Added initialization code in `app.py` to load mapping files at startup
   - Added logging of mapping statistics

6. **Ensured Heroku Compatibility**
   - Made the system work with both demo mode and database connections
   - Ensured mapping files are included in the repository for deployment

## Files Modified

- **New Files**:
  - `utils/keyword_mapping.py` - Core mapping functionality
  - `create_sample_mapping_files.py` - Script to generate mapping files
  - `KEYWORD_MAPPING.md` - Documentation

- **Modified Files**:
  - `database/data_fetchers.py` - Integrated mapping with search
  - `database/data_fetchers_freshness.py` - Integrated mapping with burst detection
  - `tabs/burstiness.py` - Updated UI to reflect mapping
  - `app.py` - Added mapping initialization

## Features

1. **Keyword Standardization**
   - Maps variations to canonical forms (e.g., "US", "USA", "United States" â†’ "united states")
   - Ensures consistent analysis across the dashboard

2. **Noise Term Filtering**
   - Excludes common noise terms (e.g., "https", "www", HTML tags)
   - Improves analysis quality by focusing on meaningful terms

3. **Frequency Aggregation**
   - Combines frequencies of variant forms
   - Provides more accurate trend detection

## Usage

The keyword mapping system works automatically in the background:

1. When a user searches for a term, it's mapped to its canonical form
2. When burst analysis is performed, keywords are mapped and aggregated
3. All visualizations display the canonical forms of keywords

## Configuration

The system can be customized by:

1. Modifying the excluded keywords list in `utils/keyword_mapping.py`
2. Updating the sample mappings in `create_sample_mapping_files.py`
3. Running the script to generate new mapping files

## Future Improvements

1. **UI for Mapping Management**
   - Add a dedicated admin interface for managing mappings
   - Allow users to add/edit mappings through the UI

2. **Enhanced Metrics**
   - Add metrics about how many terms were mapped/consolidated
   - Show original vs. mapped keyword counts

3. **Integration with More Features**
   - Extend mapping to other tabs and features
   - Add more sophisticated mapping algorithms (e.g., fuzzy matching)
